THi, my name is Shuko Ikemura. 
I am a Graphic Designer based in Tokyo. 
I have taken some workshops by BCL since a couple of years ago, these were “common flower” and “BioArt workshop by Joe Davis” and more. 
I have also joined a few company projects on genetics as a graphic designer.
I took up BIO HACK ACADEMY because I wanted to make something through these experience!
