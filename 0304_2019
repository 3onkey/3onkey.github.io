# What is your idea?

Title: Map of BioArt
Description: Information Visualisation of BioArt history, artworks, artists and science.


Information Graphics of The History of Bio-Artists
The purpose is to highlight the contributions of bio-artists to illustrate the personal aspect behind the development of the combination of biology and art. I plan to realize this by creating a timeline infographic stylizing the many artist who have contributed to the development of the field over time.

An example timeline (I will find other, better examples later -- or make a small illustrative sample):

### How are you planning to do?
・Choose several outstanding works in bio-art through development of field. Part of this will to be choose a suitable representative “beginning” of bio-art, and highlight artists who’ve made interesting or powerful contributions until now.
・Research artist and material / technical skill
・arrange the timeline 
・Output image: PDF(paper) or Website Interface. 
 


### How will it be documented? 

Unlike a research project there won’t be a “research notebook,” however, in order to create the best graphics, I will do a lot of research, make many notes, and create many drafts.
These can serve as the documentation of the thought process and allow people to interpret the creative process.
