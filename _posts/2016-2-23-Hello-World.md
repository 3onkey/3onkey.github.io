# Map of Bioart

## Description

Information Graphics of The History of Bio-Artists The purpose is to highlight the contributions of bio-artists to illustrate the personal aspect behind the development of the combination of biology and art. I plan to realize this by creating a timeline infographic stylizing the many artist who have contributed to the development of the field over time.

Bio-art approaches to connect with society and predict our future life on the planet. By doing this research and following these art activities, I believe I can get closer to the meaning our existence.
